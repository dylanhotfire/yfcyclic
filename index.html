									<h4> Forever </h4>
									<div class="line"></div>
										<p>Yes, we mean forever. As long as Ethereum is running and stable coins 
											can be staked somewhere like yearn.finance this protocol will compound and 
											reward dividends. Even after emissions have ended and the token supply is completely 
											in the hands of the community it will still reward those who hold the token. 
											Dividends can sit in the contract forever and act like a yearly pay check or be 
											collected weekly to pay for your daily coffee, its up to the user to claim their 
											dividends and all it takes is one simple transaction. Because the Autonomous Money 
											Pile is owned by the contract and guided by community governance the money held in 
											the contract remains decentralized and compounding, forever. In addition, because of the 
											modular setup of the Cyclic vaults, governance decisons are easily implemented.

								</div>
								<button class="expandable">Is this safe to invest in?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								  <p>A: We want to say yes, but the answer is: Absolutely NOT. The only value incentive the token has is governance and representing a share of dividends. It is 100% vital that you do not invest into the protocol with more than you can afford to lose. The cyclic nature of this project will likely cause measurable swings in the market from speculators and emission collectors. It is strongly urged that you take out your initial if you decide to gamble on this token and make some profit. You have been warned. </p>
								</div>
								<button class="expandable">Are the vaults safe to participate in?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								  <p>A: Our goal is to make the upcoming vaults as safe and easy to use as possible, but there is always the chance that a bug could be found, and often with solidity, bugs mean loss of funds.</p>
								</div>
								<button class="expandable">Why would I choose Cyclic over other yearn forks?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								  <p>A: While we can't guarentee we will always have the highest apy, we have taken ideas from some of the brightest and most active members in the decentralized finance community to try and deliver balance to every person that participates in this ecosystem. Our dividend reward vault is designed to increase demand of the $CYCL token, which in turn could lead to an apy on the stable coin vaults that is quite impressive! However, this is only speculation and some surface level math. The problem with most of the current yf forks is that they give nothing to the token holder, and the apy they have on their vaults is directly tied to a token that has NO value. Cyclic is trying to remedy that by giving people a reason to hold onto their tokens once they have bought or farmed them. </p>
								</div>
								<button class="expandable">How do I buy this?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								  <p>A: To buy the token simply send some Ethereum to a <a style="color:orange;" href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask Wallet</a> and then head over to <a style="color:orange;" href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x69f08bd1929ef62ecbe947d6bf76a7b7cdba55e8&outputCurrency=ETH">Uniswap</a> where you can connect your Metamask wallet and Exchange your ETH for CYCL tokens. </p>
								</div>
								<button class="expandable">Will the team reveal their identity?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								  <p>A: For now, we have no intention of revealing ourselves to the public, but once the protocol is further along and a strong community has been established we plan to give more info about ouselves.</p>
